## For newcomers

[These notes](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/fall16/lectures/01-intro.html) are a widely used introduction to Haskell.

[Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) is a friendly introductory book, with an [interactive notebook version](https://github.com/IHaskell/learn-you-a-haskell-notebook).

[This Youtube series](https://github.com/haskell-beginners-2022/course-plan) is a popular video tutorial for Haskell.

### Project-based learning

[Learn Haskell by building a blog generator](https://lhbg-book.link) is a free book that takes a project-based approach to learning Haskell.

## Community

Haskell has an active [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/) with a [dedicated section](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/collection/f998970b-a622-480a-aed4-f8d9ad64ee7b) for questions.

It also has its own [forum](https://discourse.haskell.org/).

## Understanding the ecosystem

[This package overview](/packages/survey/) is very useful for quickly understanding what Haskell packages to use for what tasks.

[haskell-links.org](https://haskell-links.org) presents links from #haskell IRC/Matrix chatters, with a fast search interface.



## More advanced resources

[This reference guide/tutorial](https://smunix.github.io/dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/tutorial.pdf) carefully and clearly details important advanced concepts and features in Haskell.

[This performance guide](https://haskell.foundation/hs-opt-handbook.github.io/) explains how to engineer programs in Haskell to be as fast as possible.

[The Haskell report](https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/) is an exhaustive and carefully written reference manual of all of Haskell.

### Friendly libraries

[pipes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) is a useful library for *streaming* which has very friendly documentation including a [tutorial](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.16/docs/Pipes-Tutorial.html). This is a good library to understand how to think functionally, and how to use monads practically.

[foldl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foldl) is a beautifully documented library for writing folds (aka reduces) that are efficient and makes one pass over data. This is a good library to expand your understanding of `Functor` and `Applicative`, and to understand efficiency concerns in a functional language.

[diagrams](https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/) is a very well documented and powerful library for constructing 2D diagrams.
### Compiler

[This is the guide to the Haskell compiler, GHC](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/)

A guide on [how to implement an interpreter](http://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/) (with sophisticated types)
